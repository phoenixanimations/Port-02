sarcastiguard will KB you, serious guard will throw you (which is essentially also a KB)

Dream sequence. Rattmann appears!
Walks in (from the right side), pulls out a (huge) scroll that says 'Tutorial'/'Manual'

'You and I know that you and I both don't want to be here.
'So here's the deal, the faster you complete this, the faster we can both get out of here.
'But don't think that you'll be better off by not listening

Wake up surrounded by Dante's followers-or-whatever

Dante HAS the staff, Serulian is locked away in the Dimension World, unable to escape

Dante knows that you're powerful, 'I sense great power in you.'
'I need to ask a favor of you. This is a powerful staff, capable of opening dimensions. I have trapped a prisoner inside the other dimension and I him to be executed. These guards will perform the execution, all I need you to do is open the dimension world using the staff. I am too weak to use it currently, and this man will also be weak.'

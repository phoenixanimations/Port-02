Intro_Dante_v1_1_part2

You: Well, I guess I do owe you a favor ...
Dante: Fantastic! To start, you will need a map.
- Dante sits up in his bed and hands you a map.
Map Get!
[You read the map.]
After reading the map, you look up at Dante.
You: This is pretty far you know.
Dante: It is no farther than my bodyguards had to travel to find you.
You: There is a more direct path than the one you have outlined. You realize this ...
Dante: You are correct, however that path is not nearly as safe as the one I have marked.
* [Surely it's safer than assassinating a madman.]
You: Surely it's safer than assassinating a madman.
Dante: This has to be done. The ring he holds has great power. In the wrong hands, it could bring devastation to us all. The short, more dangerous path is not a necessary risk.
You: I suppose.
* [Fine. We'll take the long route.]
You: Fine. We'll take the long route.
Dante: Excellent.
Dante: You will also need this.
Dante reaches underneath his bed to pull out an ancient-looking, ornate staff.
Dante: I bestow this unto you in the most dire necessity. Please take care of it - it is even more dangerous than the ring.
As you reach out to take the staff you feel an odd resonance, as though the staff is vibrating uncontrollably ...
... but it is entirely still.
You take the staff from Dante and feel an incredible surge of power from within. Suddenly, you feel more powerful, as though your strength has increased tenfold, and with it, you feel the darkness of your heart grow.
Staff get!
You: Before I go, I'd like to know; why is is that you trust me?
Dante: ...
Dante: ... because I must.
